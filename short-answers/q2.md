# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

Labels are important for accessibility and usability. They provide context and improve the accessibility of forms, especially for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies. The two ways to associated a label with an input is wither through either nesting or with the `for` attribute.

```
//Nesting:
<label>
Username
<input type="text" name="username" />
</label>
//`for` attribute:
<label for="username-input">Username</label>
<input id="username-input" type="text" name="username" />
```
