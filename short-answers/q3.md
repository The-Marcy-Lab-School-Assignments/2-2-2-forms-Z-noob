# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

The first two both have a submit event by default. The third one submits the form it belongs to when clicked, triggering a form submission to the server. If the button is not within a form element, it has no effect. For the last one, this button does not have the same submit default behavior like the first two, ~~,~~ and its action needs to be defined explicitly using JavaScript event handlers.

# Teacher Feedback

You are so close, the third button will reset the form meaning that all of the user data will be cleared!
